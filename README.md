3. **Styling:** Designed the layout using CSS and ensured responsiveness.
4. **Functionality:** Implemented interactivity with JavaScript and React state management.
5. **Bug Fixes & Refinements:** Resolved minor issues and improved UI.
6. **Documentation:** Created this README file to document the project.
7. **Deployment:** Uploaded the project to GitHub and hosted it online.

- **Flexbox** for layout structuring
- **JavaScript** for interactivity
- **React** for state management and UI updates
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
- **Desktop-first workflow** for initial design, later adapted for mobile

### Key Takeaways

While working on this project, I improved in several areas:

- **State Management in React:** Learned how to toggle notification states using `.map()` without creating unnecessary duplicates.
- **Component-based Structure:** Gained experience in breaking UI into reusable React components.

### Future Improvements
